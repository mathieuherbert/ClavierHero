 * Configure the first timer of the 82c54 chip as a rate generator,
 * which will raise an IRQ0 on a regular periodic basis, as given by
 * the freq parameter. Second (RAM refresh) and third (speaker) timers
 * are left unchanged. Maximum frequency is that of the 8254 clock, ie
 * 1193180 Hz.
 *
 * Ahhh PC systems are nice toys: this maximum "strange" frequency
 * equals that of the NTSC clock (14.31818 MHz) divided by 12. In
 * turn, the famous 4.77 MHz cpu clock frequency of the first IBM PC
 * is this same NTSC frequency divided by 3. Why the NTSC frequency as
 * a base "standard" ? Because the 14.31818 MHz quartz were cheap at
 * that time, and because it allows to simply drive altogether the
 * cpu, the "time of day" timer, and the video signal generators.
