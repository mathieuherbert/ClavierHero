/**
 * The identifier of the thread currently running on CPU.
 *
 * We only support a SINGLE processor, ie a SINGLE thread
 * running at any time in the system. This greatly simplifies the
 * implementation of the system, since we don't have to complicate
 * things in order to retrieve the identifier of the threads running
 * on the CPU. On multiprocessor systems the current_thread below is
 * an array indexed by the id of the CPU, so that the challenge is to
 * retrieve the identifier of the CPU. This is usually done based on
 * the stack address (Linux implementation) or on some form of TLS
 * ("Thread Local Storage": can be implemented by way of LDTs for the
 * processes, accessed through the fs or gs registers).
